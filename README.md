# Lesson 4. Continuous random variables. Distribution function and probability distribution density. Uniform and normal distribution. The Central limit theorem
A random continuous quantity A has a uniform distribution over the interval (200, 800].
Find its average value and variance.

It is known about a random continuous uniformly distributed quantity B that its variance is 0.2.

The growth of the adult population of City X has a normal distribution.
Moreover, the average height is 174 cm, and the mean square deviation is 8 cm.
What is the probability that a randomly selected adult has a height of:
a). more than 182 cm
b). more than 190 cm
in). from 166 cm to 190 cm
d). from 166 cm to 182 cm
d). from 158 cm to 190 cm
e). not higher than 150 cm or not lower than 190 cm
e). not higher than 150 cm or not lower than 198 cm
w). below 166 cm .
By how many sigma (mean square deviations) does the height of a person equal to 190 cm deviate from
the mathematical expectation of growth in a population in which M(X) = 178 cm and D(X) = 25 sq. cm?
# Lesson 5. Testing statistical hypotheses. P-values. Confidence intervals. A/B testing
It is known that the general population is normally distributed

As a result of 10 independent measurements of a certain value X, performed with the same accuracy,
experimental data were obtained:
6.9, 6.1, 6.2, 6.8, 7.5, 6.3, 6.4, 6.9, 6.7, 6.1
Assuming that the measurement results are subject to the normal probability distribution law,

value with a confidence probability of 0.95.
Run a hypothesis test. It is claimed that the bearing balls made by an automatic machine have an average diameter of 17 mm.
Using a one-sided criterion with α = 0.05, test this hypothesis if in a sample of n = 100 balls the average diameter
turned out to be 17.5 mm, and the variance is known and equal to 4 sq. mm.

Run a hypothesis test. The seller claims that the average weight of a pack of cookies is 200 g.
A sample of 10 packs was extracted from the batch. The weight of each pack is:
202, 203, 199, 197, 195, 201, 200, 204, 194, 190.
It is known that their weights are distributed normally.
Is the seller's statement true, given that the confidence probability is 99%? (Conduct a two-way test.)
